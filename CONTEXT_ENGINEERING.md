# Context Engineering in Tide

## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering is the practice of designing, building, and maintaining systems that provide Large Language Models (LLMs) with the most relevant and accurate information to perform a given task. It is a crucial discipline for maximizing the performance, accuracy, and reliability of AI-powered applications.

The core idea behind Context Engineering is that the quality of an LLM's output is directly proportional to the quality of its input. By carefully curating the context provided to the model, we can significantly improve its ability to understand complex requests, generate high-quality code, and provide insightful assistance.

### Key Pillars of Context Engineering

We believe that effective Context Engineering is built on three key pillars:

1.  **Prompt Engineering:** This involves crafting clear, concise, and unambiguous instructions for the LLM. A well-designed prompt can guide the model towards the desired output and prevent it from making common mistakes.

2.  **Context Management:** This involves collecting, organizing, and presenting relevant information to the LLM. This can include:
    *   **Conversation History:** Maintaining a record of the conversation to provide the model with a sense of continuity.
    *   **Project Context:** Understanding the structure of the codebase, the dependencies between different files, and the overall architecture of the project.
    *   **Real-time Information:** Providing the model with up-to-date information about the state of the system, such as the current file being edited, the output of a command, or the results of a test run.

3.  **Tool Chaining:** This involves providing the LLM with a set of tools that it can use to interact with the environment. By chaining together different tools, the model can perform complex tasks that would be impossible with a single tool. For example, it could use a file system tool to read a file, a code editor tool to modify it, and a terminal tool to run a test.

## Context Engineering in Tide

In Tide, we are committed to practicing and advancing the state-of-the-art in Context Engineering. Here's how we are applying these principles in our IDE:

### 1. Prompt Engineering

The `agent/agent.go` file is the heart of our prompt engineering efforts. The `ReActAgent` struct defines the core logic for constructing the prompts that are sent to the LLM. We are constantly refining these prompts to improve the agent's performance and reliability.

### 2. Context Management

We are building a sophisticated context management system that will provide the LLM with a deep understanding of the project. This will include:

*   **A persistent conversation history:** The `conversation_history.json` file stores the history of the conversation, allowing the agent to remember previous interactions and maintain context over time.
*   **A project-aware agent:** We are developing a system that will allow the agent to understand the structure of the codebase, the dependencies between different files, and the overall architecture of the project. This will enable the agent to provide more intelligent and context-aware assistance.

### 3. Tool Chaining

The `tool/` directory contains the various tools that the agent can use to interact with the system. Each tool is designed to be a modular and reusable component that can be chained together to perform complex tasks. For example, the agent could use the `file_editor.go` tool to modify a file, and then use the `terminal.go` tool to run a test to verify the changes.

By focusing on these three pillars of Context Engineering, we believe that we can build a truly intelligent and capable AI-powered IDE that will revolutionize the way we write software.
